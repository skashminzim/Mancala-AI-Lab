# Mancala-AI-Lab
Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces. The player with the most seeds in his/her store at the end of the game wins. It is can involve a human player as well as AI agent. The AI agent is required to decide its move by using adversarial algorithms including minimax algorithm and alpha-beta algorithm as well as by a random strategy. In this experiment, adversarial search algorithm and other necessary functions are applied to implement the game.<br><br>
We built the problem “Mancala” using programming language Java
and used the console window to show the output. The steps for solving the
problem was to represent game board with the implementation of the pits on each
side, generating user input for human move and implementing Alpha-beta pruning
algorithm for decision making to find the optimal move for computer as a player.
