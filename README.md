# Mancala-AI-Lab
Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces. The player with the most seeds in his/her store at the end of the game wins. It is can involve a human player as well as AI agent. The AI agent is required to decide its move by using adversarial algorithms including minimax algorithm and alpha-beta algorithm as well as by a random strategy. In this experiment, adversarial search algorithm and other necessary functions are applied to implement the game.
